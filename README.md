# fighter-game

A simple 2D platform game concept written in C++. Dependencies include the SDL2 and SDL2_image library. After installing them, change your directory to the root of this folder and run `make` in commandline. If you're on windows, you might have to change the include tags from `#include <SDL2/SDL.h>` to `#include <SDL.h>`.
